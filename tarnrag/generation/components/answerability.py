"""The answerability gate (PP-2) — refuse *before* the read when the evidence can't support the query.

A wrapper ``Reasoner``: it probes retrieval once and checks that the query's **exact-match cues** —
double-quoted spans and identifier tokens (``§6.4.2``, error codes, part numbers; the same
``core.text`` cues the classifier labels and the sparse builder phrases) — actually appear in the
retrieved evidence. A cue no passage covers means the corpus doesn't mention the thing being asked
about, so the gate returns a refusal naming what's missing instead of letting the reader guess
(``abstained=True`` — the pipeline surfaces it without spending the read or the verification).
Queries with no checkable cues pass straight through to the wrapped reasoner, as do covered ones
(the child re-retrieves; retrieval is cheap — the LLM read is the cost being saved). Coverage is
checked against the reader-facing rendering (``passage_text``), so a value inside a table counts.
