"""GenerationEngine — question → answer + proof tree + evidence (the Goal-3 facade).

The library entry point, sibling of ``IngestionEngine`` / ``RetrievalEngine``. ``create()`` wires the
composition root: it builds the retrieval engine (consumed through the ``RetrievalEngineProtocol`` port),
the ``LanguageModel`` resource (``LanguageModel.create`` over ``Settings.llm``), and the
``GenerationPipeline`` from the ``GENERATION_PIPELINE`` spec — then delegates ``answer`` to the pipeline
over a ``GenerationContext``. tiqtasq.backend wraps this in REST. Building a concrete ``RetrievalEngine``
here is the allowed direction (``generation → retrieval``); the pipeline + seams only ever see the port.
