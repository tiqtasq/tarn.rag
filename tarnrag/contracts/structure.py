"""Structured-document contracts — the layout-aware extraction model.

Produced by a format extractor (PDF/Markdown/…) and refined by enrichment components, a
``StructuredDocument`` is the rich, in-flight representation of one ingested document: an ordered
list of ``Element``s (reading order) with hierarchy, per-element geometry, header paths, and
extensible enricher ``Annotation``s. It is the *document-phase* payload on ``PipelineItem`` (the
*chunk-phase* carries ``ChunkProvenance`` instead).

Geometry decomposition (the load-bearing decision): **char offsets are universal, page boxes are
additive.** Every ``Span`` carries ``start``/``end`` offsets into the document's normalized ``text``
(the substrate that gets chunked and embedded), so all offset-based work (overlap, text-view
highlighting, late chunking, sub-element annotation spans) is uniform across PDF and text; a span
*additionally* carries page ``boxes`` when the source is paged/visual (PDF).

This module is contracts only — no extractor, enricher, chunker, or schema (see
``doc/structured-document-design.md`` and ``doc/layout-aware-extraction-requirements.md``).
