"""Cross-boundary data contracts (DTOs).

At the core are four models that are TWO FORMS of the things being ingested — not four
unrelated types, and not an inheritance hierarchy:

* IN-FLIGHT form -> ``PipelineItem``. The single, uniform type that flows between
  stages. A *document* (at Load/Clean) and a *chunk* (at Chunk/Enrich/Embed) are
  BOTH just ``PipelineItem``s; which one it is rides in ``metadata`` (e.g.
  ``chunk_index``), not in the type. The engine (stages, worker, DAG, inline job
  payload) is generic over this one type, so it stays stage- and entity-agnostic.

* AT-REST form -> ``Document`` / ``Chunk`` / ``Embedding``. Typed persistence records
  (DTOs) materialised at the ResultSinks to write rows (and reconstructed on reads).
  They NEVER flow; the persistent schema is the SQLAlchemy ``Table``s in
  ``DocumentRepository``, which maps each DTO to/from its table.

Worked trace of one ingest — watch the form change:

    after Load    PipelineItem(content="<doc text>", metadata={source_id, doc_id})
    after Chunk   PipelineItem(content="<chunk 3>",  metadata={..., chunk_index: 3})
                      |  ChunkResultSink persists it ->
                      v
                  Chunk(id="c3", parent_doc_id="d1", content="<chunk 3>", chunk_index=3)
    after Embed   Embedding(chunk_id="c3", vector=[...])   # terminal: never flows

So a chunk-in-flight IS a ``PipelineItem``; ``Chunk`` is its stored row. ``Embedding``
is the exception — Embed is the terminal stage, so an embedding is only ever at-rest.

Why two forms, not one: the in-flight form is deliberately loose (one uniform type +
a metadata bag) so the engine is generic and extensible; the at-rest form is typed so
the storage contract is explicit and validated (``store_chunks`` guarantees real
``parent_doc_id`` / ``chunk_index`` fields, not "hopefully in a dict"). The field
overlap (id/content/metadata) is what makes them look alike, but it is coincidental
and diverges (``Chunk`` adds FKs, ``Embedding`` has no content) — hence no shared base
or inheritance. The relations that DO hold are composition (``Chunk.parent_doc_id`` ->
``Document``, ``Embedding.chunk_id`` -> ``Chunk``) and transformation (a sink maps a
``PipelineItem`` into a DTO) — expressed by fields and functions, not a hierarchy.

Two small value records round out the module: ``DocumentFacts`` (a document's presence +
chunk/embedding counts, the facts port's return type) and ``MethodRef`` (a reference to an
indexed method, used in both queries and results).

    ``vec_chunks`` table), so ``id`` / ``model`` / ``dimension`` are dropped there. 

    The embedding vectors themselves are stored in both backends. It is the terminal output of the 
    ingestion pipeline:

    EmbedStage ──yields──▶  Embedding(chunk_id, vector, model, dimension)     ← the DTO

     model, dimension)                 columns; id/model/dimension are dropped)

    - Postgres: PostgresRepository uses the base store_embeddings, which writes every DTO field to the embeddings table
      (vector as a pgvector column, plus id, chunk_id, model, dimension).
    - SQLite: SqliteRepository overrides store_embeddings and writes to the sqlite-vec virtual table vec_chunks instead 
      (the embeddings table exists in the schema but stays empty there). Virtual tables have a fixed shape:
      (chunk_id, embedding float[dim]), so only those two fields land; id/model/dimension are dropped on this 
      backend.

    Why the DTO is "write-only": retrieval never reads Embedding objects back. Dense search (dense_knn) queries the vector 
    index directly — sqlite-vec's MATCH / pgvector's cosine operator — and gets back (chunk_id, distance) pairs; the text 
    and provenance are then hydrated from the chunks table. No code path ever materializes a stored vector back into an 
    Embedding.
