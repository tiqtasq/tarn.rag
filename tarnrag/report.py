"""Structured, user-facing reports for the TarnRag facade.

Every facade call returns an :class:`Outcome` — its ``value`` plus a :class:`Report` of any
:class:`Issue`\\ s encountered alongside it. The report is *empty* (and falsy) when all went well, so
there is nothing to show; non-fatal problems — a path that wasn't found, a partial failure — are recorded
here rather than printed or silently skipped, and every UI over the facade (the console, the tiqtasq REST
API) decides how to surface them. Fatal failures still raise; the report is for issues the call carried on
*past*.
