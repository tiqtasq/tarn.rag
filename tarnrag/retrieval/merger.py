"""The Merger component family: post-retrieval auto-merging.

A ``Merger`` is an optional, config-driven ``Component`` that rewrites the surviving (already filtered)
result set before truncation. ``auto_merge`` collapses retrieved sibling leaf chunks into their shared
section parent (via the persisted ``parent_chunk_id``), so the model gets one coherent section instead of
several adjacent fragments. Like the other retrieval seams it's a pure strategy — the store is injected at
call time via the ``RetrievalContext`` (the parent chunk is hydrated on demand).
