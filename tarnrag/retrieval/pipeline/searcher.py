"""The Searcher seam — the one thing the engine builds from the ``RETRIEVAL_PIPELINE`` spec.

A ``Searcher`` is a config-driven ``Component`` that turns a query into ranked results over a
``RetrievalContext``. Both the plain ``RetrievalPipeline`` and the ``RoutingRetrievalPipeline`` implement
it, so the engine (and the eval sweep) build ``create_as(spec, Searcher)`` — and that one spec can name
*either* a single pipeline *or* a router, with no new ``Settings`` key. The router's routes are themselves
``Searcher``s, so routing composes (a route is just another pipeline spec, or a nested router).
