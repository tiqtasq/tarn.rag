"""TarnRag — the high-level facade over tarn.rag's ingestion + retrieval + generation engines.

A small, **output-free** session API over one store: ``ingest`` / ``docs`` / ``delete`` / ``retrieve`` /
``ask``. Each returns an :class:`~tarnrag.report.Outcome` — the value it produced, plus a
:class:`~tarnrag.report.Report` of any non-fatal issues encountered (empty when all went well). Nothing is
printed and nothing is silently skipped: a UI over the facade (the console, the tiqtasq REST API) renders
the value and surfaces the report. ``TarnRag`` is the composition root: it builds the one store (the
repository) and the embedder once and injects both into the engines that run over them (one connection —
retrieval sees ingests live, and works on an empty store); the generation engine is built lazily on the
first ``ask``. Use it directly::

    async with TarnRag("config.json") as tarn:
        ingested = await tarn.ingest(["documents/"])
        for issue in ingested.report.issues:
            ...  # e.g. a path that wasn't found
        answer = await tarn.ask("…")
        print(answer.value.answer)

…or behind a UI. ``llm`` may be injected (tests / a custom backend).
