    This is what the queue (``JobConsumer``) hands the worker, and the compute batch a
    stage runs in one shot. Same-stage homogeneity is the invariant that makes a batch
    *meaningful* — a single stage runs the whole batch, and two-tier batching (D2) only
    batches compute *within* a stage. A mixed-stage batch is therefore not a thing.

    The invariant is enforced HERE, at construction, so callers (the worker, the
    coordinator) can rely on a single ``stage_name`` without re-checking. ``stage_name``
    stays on each ``IngestionJob`` (the queue routes by it); ``Batch`` derives the batch's
    stage from its jobs and refuses a mismatch. Forming Batches is the queue's job — when
    batch dispatch claims several jobs, it must group them so each Batch is homogeneous.
