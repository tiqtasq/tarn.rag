"""Chunking: split a loaded document into retrieval chunks + the auto-merging tree.

Importing this package registers the ``Chunk`` stage and the built-in chunkers (``structure_aware``,
``recursive``) with the global ``ComponentFactory``, so ``Pipeline.from_spec`` / ``ComponentFactory``
can build them. The chunkers are imported before ``ChunkStage`` (the driver builds a chunker child).
