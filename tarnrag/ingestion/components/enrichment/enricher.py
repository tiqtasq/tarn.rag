"""The Enricher component family: annotate a ``StructuredDocument`` after extraction (FR-5).

An ``Enricher`` is a pure ``Component`` that appends typed ``Annotation``s to a document's elements (or
the document itself) — entities, topics, classifications, … — each recording its ``producer`` and a
deterministic-vs-generative flag (anti-hallucination). The ``EnrichStage`` runs a configured, ordered
list of them over ``item.document``; the annotations then flow into chunks (the chunker aggregates
element annotations into ``ChunkProvenance``). Users register their own (NER/topic) behind this port on
the same framework — no base-class edits (AC-2).
