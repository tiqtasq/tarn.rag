"""Layout-aware extraction: a ``Source`` → ``StructuredDocument`` seam, the built-in extractors, and
the ``LoadAndParse`` stage that drives them.

Importing this package registers the built-in extractors *and* the ``LoadAndParse`` stage with the
global ``ComponentFactory`` (each self-registers under its ``class_name``), so ``Pipeline.from_spec`` /
``ComponentFactory`` can build them. ``LoadAndParseStage`` is imported last: it pulls in the ``extractor``
submodule, which the lines above have already loaded.
