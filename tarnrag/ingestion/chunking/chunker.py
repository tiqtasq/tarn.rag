"""The Chunker component family: a ``StructuredDocument`` → retrieval chunks.

A ``Chunker`` is a pure ``Component`` (document in, chunks out); the ``ChunkStage`` driver builds the
configured chunker and threads each chunk's ``ChunkProvenance`` onto the chunk-phase ``PipelineItem``.
This is the same shape extraction uses — an ``Extractor`` does the work, ``LoadAndParse`` drives it —
and being a pure function makes a chunker unit-testable without the pipeline.

``Chunker.TempChunk`` is the *in-flight* emission unit (text + provenance + a positional parent link).
The ``Temp*`` prefix is the convention for a pipeline-phase, pre-persistence representation, distinct
from the at-rest ``tarnrag.contracts.Chunk`` DTO (built only at storage time).
