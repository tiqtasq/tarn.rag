"""Job queue ports + adapters.

The queue surface is segregated by role: ``JobEnqueuer`` (producer — the orchestrator
puts jobs on the queue) and ``JobConsumer`` (the runtime — register a handler and run
the dispatch loop, which belongs to the queue technology). One adapter implements both:
``PgQueuerJobQueue`` (the only place that touches pgQueuer, lazily imported) and
``InMemoryJobQueue`` (a test double that runs the whole flow with no Postgres/pgQueuer).
