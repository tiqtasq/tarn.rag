"""Example 02 — Retrieval over the JSON-configured store (embedded mode, SQLite).

Queries the store that ``example_02/ingestion.py`` built with the small-chunk pipeline. Note what
this script does NOT need: the pipeline JSON. Retrieval only embeds the query and searches — it
depends on the *embedding identity* (shared via ``base_settings``), not on how ingestion chunked.
So this is the same ``base_settings(db_path)`` as example 01; the smaller chunks just mean shorter,
more focused snippets come back.

Run (after the ingestion example has populated the store):

    python -m examples.part_i.example_02.retrieval
