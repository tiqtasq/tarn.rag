"""Example 01 — Ingestion (embedded mode, SQLite).

The smallest end-to-end ingestion you can run: read the shared sample corpus from
``examples/docs/``, configure tarnrag for *embedded* mode over a local SQLite file, and report
what was stored. Config and shared helpers live in ``examples/common.py``.

In embedded mode the whole pipeline (load -> clean -> chunk -> enrich -> embed -> persist) runs
in THIS process — no Postgres, no job queue — so each ingest call returns only once the
documents are fully chunked, embedded, and written to the SQLite store.

Setup (once, from the repo root):

    pip install -e ".[onnx]"       # the tarnrag package + the ONNX embedding runtime
    python scripts/fetch_model.py  # download the embedding model + tokenizer (needs network)

Run (from the repo root):

    python -m examples.part_i.example_01.ingestion

Then query the same store with the retrieval example (which reuses the same shared config).
