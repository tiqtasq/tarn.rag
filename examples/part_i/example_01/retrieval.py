"""Example 01 — Retrieval (embedded mode, SQLite).

Query the store that ``ingestion.py`` built. The same ``TarnRag`` facade opens that store and embeds
each query with the SAME embedding identity ingestion used (the config is shared via
``examples/common.py``), runs a dense k-NN search over the SQLite vector index, and returns ranked,
provenance-bearing hits.

Run it after the ingestion example has populated the store (same one-time setup — see
``ingestion.py``):

    python -m examples.part_i.example_01.retrieval
