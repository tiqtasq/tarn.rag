"""Part II · Example 03 — cross-encoder reranking.

One config change from Example 02: a cross-encoder ``reranker`` on the ``retrieval_pipeline``. It re-scores
the fused top candidates by true query–passage relevance, so it gets the **best of both** — it recovers the
paraphrase that hybrid demoted AND keeps the part-number win:

  * paraphrase   → dense ✓ → hybrid ✗ → rerank ✓
  * part number  → dense ✗ → hybrid ✓ → rerank ✓

But the reranker ranks individual *chunks*, so a question whose answer spans a whole section comes back as
a fragment — the single best chunk holds only some of the steps. Example 04 (structure-aware chunking +
auto-merge) returns the whole coherent section.

Run from the repo root::

    python -m examples.part_ii.example_03.run

Needs the reranker model (a separate one-time fetch)::

    python scripts/fetch_model.py --repo Xenova/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 --dest ./models/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2
