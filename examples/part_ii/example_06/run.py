"""Part II · Example 06 — minimal generation (the Act B opener).

Act A retrieved passages; Act B reads them into an ANSWER. The base generation_pipeline (single_hop reasoner
+ provenance assembler) does one retrieve→read pass and returns the answer plus a *proof tree* — which chunk
backed it. The good case: an answerable question comes back grounded, with its evidence.

The limitation this opener exposes (and Example 07 addresses): the minimal pipeline *trusts the reader* —
there's no grounding verification and no abstain. So a question the corpus can't answer comes back as a
terse non-answer that is still reported as grounded and non-abstained: the system can't tell "I answered"
from "I couldn't".

Run from the repo root (after Example 00 built the base store)::

    python -m examples.part_ii.example_06.run

`ask` needs the LLM key in OPENAI_LLM_KEY (loaded from the repo-root .env) and `pip install '.[openai]'`.
