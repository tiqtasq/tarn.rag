"""The thin teaching shell for the Part II examples — the narration around a YAML config.

Each example *is* a YAML config (run it directly with ``python -m tarnrag.console cfg.yaml``); the
:class:`Runner` is the scripted story around it. An example's ``run.py`` opens a
:class:`~tarnrag.TarnRag` over its config, wraps it in a ``Runner``, ingests the shared corpus once, then
runs a *good* and a *bad* probe through retrieval (showing the ``explain`` breakdown) and — in the
generation act — through ``ask``, marking each probe HIT/MISS against a gold phrase so the failure a step
demonstrates, and the next step's fix, is **shown**, not asserted.

The rendering is the console's own static factory methods (``Console.create_trace_view`` /
``create_results_table`` / ``create_answer_view``) — one renderer, two surfaces: the REPL and these
examples. ``Runner`` adds only the teaching orchestration (it stays in the examples layer, out of the
library). Needs the ``console`` extra (rich).
