"""Part II · Example 04 — structure-aware chunking + auto-merge.

The first re-ingest: the Chunk stage switches from `recursive` to `structure_aware`, which builds a section
tree (leaf chunks + section parents). Because the representation changes, this builds its OWN store
(structured.db). Two things follow:

  * FIX — Example 03's fragmentation goes away: a section-spanning question retrieves the whole coherent
    *section* (the parent chunk), not a single fragment, so the full answer comes back;
  * AUTO-MERGE — when several sibling leaf fragments of one section are retrieved, they're collapsed into
    their parent, so the top-k isn't dominated by one document's pieces (more diverse results).

Run from the repo root::

    python -m examples.part_ii.example_04.run

Needs the embedder + the reranker model (see Example 03's header for the reranker fetch).
