# tarn.rag

**tarnrag** — composable, DAG-based RAG **ingestion + retrieval + generation** engines: documents in, a
queryable vector index out, optionally a grounded answer with a proof tree. Pure library — there is no HTTP
layer here (a consuming REST API lives in the separate **tiqtasq.backend** repo).

- **Ingestion** — a config-driven pipeline (extract → enrich → clean → chunk → embed) writing one store
  (a §8 index: documents · chunks · vectors · FTS · metadata), embedded (SQLite + sqlite-vec/FTS5) or
  distributed (Postgres + pgvector, pgQueuer workers).
- **Retrieval** — config-driven, swappable Components: dense / sparse retrievers → RRF fusion → license &
  scope pre-filter → auto-merge → cross-encoder rerank, with layout-grade provenance on every hit.
- **Generation** — multi-hop reasoning (single-hop / iterative / decomposition) → grounding check →
  proof tree + evidence, over the retrieval substrate. LLM-pluggable; retrieval stays LLM-free by default.

## Install

```bash
pip install tarn-rag
```

The base install is the lightweight SQLite/embedded path. Backends and features are **extras**:

| Extra | Adds |
|---|---|
| `onnx` | local ONNX embedding (`onnxruntime` + `tokenizers`) |
| `embeddings-api` | hosted embedding APIs (OpenAI / Voyage / Gemini) |
| `parsers` | PDF/HTML document loaders (`pypdf`, `pdfplumber`, `beautifulsoup4`) |
| `docling` | high-fidelity layout-aware PDF extraction (heavy) |
| `generation` | the Anthropic LLM backend for the generation layer (`anthropic`) |
| `openai` | any OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` LLM backend (`httpx`) |
| `console` | the interactive `tarnrag` console UI (`rich`) |
| `benchmarks` | the HuggingFace loaders for the QA benchmarks (`datasets`) |
| `postgres` / `queue` | the distributed backends (`asyncpg` + `pgvector` / `pgqueuer`) |
| `all` | the common embedded runtime (`onnx`, `parsers`, `embeddings-api`, `generation`, `openai`, `console`) |

```bash
pip install "tarn-rag[onnx,parsers]"     # local embedder + PDF/HTML extraction
pip install "tarn-rag[all]"              # the full single-process runtime
pip install "tarn-rag[postgres,queue]"  # the distributed backends
```

## Quickstart — the interactive console

The fastest way to try tarn.rag end to end (needs the `console` extra, included in `all`). Start it with
one JSON config — a `Settings` document naming the database, embedder, LLM, and pipeline specs; a sample
lives at [`examples/console.config.json`](./examples/console.config.json):

```bash
tarnrag examples/console.config.json     # or: python -m tarnrag.console <config.json>
```

The LLM key is read from the environment (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), not the config, and the sample config
expects the local embedding model fetched once with `scripts/fetch_model.py`. Then work the corpus at
the `tarn>` prompt:

```
tarn> ingest examples/docs/corpus-1/    # ingest (or re-ingest) files; a directory ingests the files in it
tarn> docs                  # list the ingested documents (id, chunks, embeddings)
tarn> retrieve <query>      # retrieval only — the ranked passages
tarn> explain <query>       # retrieval with its inner workings — per-retriever candidates, per-stage ranking
tarn> ask <query>           # retrieval + generation — the grounded answer + its proof tree
tarn> help                  # the full list (also: status, delete, quit)
```

Full walkthrough: [docs/tutorials/console-session.md](./docs/tutorials/console-session.md).

## Quickstart — the Python API

The high-level facade (`TarnRag`) wires ingestion + retrieval + generation over one store; each call returns
an `Outcome` (the value) plus a `Report` of any non-fatal issues:

```python
import asyncio
from tarnrag import TarnRag

async def main():
    async with TarnRag("config.json") as tarn:   # a JSON Settings file
        await tarn.ingest(["path/to/your/files"]) # ingest files / directories
        hits = await tarn.retrieve("how do I inspect a tank?", top_k=8)
        answer = await tarn.ask("…")             # grounded answer + proof tree (needs an LLM key)
        print(answer.value.answer)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Or drive the engines directly (each built from `Settings` via `create()`):

```python
from tarnrag import IngestionEngine, RetrievalEngine

engine = await IngestionEngine.create()
ids = await engine.ingest_paths(["/data/spec.pdf"])

async with await RetrievalEngine.create() as r:   # validates schema + embedding fingerprint
    results = await r.search_text("how do I inspect a tank?", top_k=8)
```

[documentation index](./docs/index.md) for everything beyond the quickstarts.

## The quality profile

The default retrieval pipeline is hybrid (dense + BM25, RRF-fused). For quality-sensitive
deployments, add the local cross-encoder reranker (measured: table source-hit 0.853 → 0.926 on
TAT-QA; costs ~seconds/query of CPU — see `doc/phases.md`):

```yaml
components:
  retrieval_pipeline:
    class_name: retrieval_pipeline
    retrievers: [{class_name: dense}, {class_name: sparse}]
    fuser: {class_name: rrf}
    reranker: {class_name: cross_encoder, top_n: 20}
```

(Fetch the reranker model once with `scripts/fetch_model.py`; it loads lazily on first use.)

**If the reranker's CPU cost is out of budget**, two measured cheaper levers exist (S1 sweep,
`doc/phases.md`) — on TAT-QA each recovers about half the reranker's lift (+0.015 overall,
+0.031–0.042 on tables over plain hybrid):

- **Sparse-weighted hybrid** (LLM-free): up-weight the BM25 arm where the corpus rewards
  exact-token matching — `fuser: {class_name: rrf, weights: {sparse: 3.0}}`. Only the ratios
  matter; tune the weight per corpus with `scripts/run_layout_eval.py --s1`.
- **Query-routed retrieval** (~1 LLM call per semantic query): a `routing_retrieval_pipeline`
  with the structural classifier — multi-query expansion helps natural-language questions but
  *hurts* keyword/exact-match ones, and routing applies each arm only where it wins:

  ```yaml
  components:
    retrieval_pipeline:
      class_name: routing_retrieval_pipeline
      classifier: {class_name: structural}
      routes:
        semantic:
          class_name: retrieval_pipeline
          retrievers: [{class_name: multi_query}, {class_name: sparse}]
          fuser: {class_name: rrf}
      default:
        class_name: retrieval_pipeline
        retrievers: [{class_name: dense}, {class_name: sparse}]
        fuser: {class_name: rrf}
  ```

  The route taken is recorded on the search trace (`explain`), so every answer can show *why* it
  was retrieved the way it was. Don't stack these under the reranker: measured, the CE subsumes
  both (identical scores with and without routing beneath it).

**For multi-hop question answering over a large corpus** (recall-limited, P7 in `doc/phases.md`),
the measured composition is HyDE retrieval + a pooled-evidence rerank on the decomposition
reasoner — on the HotpotQA pool it lifts answer F1 0.620 → 0.665 and hit 0.486 → 0.541 over
plain hybrid:

```yaml
components:
  retrieval_pipeline:
    class_name: retrieval_pipeline
    retrievers: [{class_name: hyde}, {class_name: sparse}]   # fake-answer probe + BM25
    fuser: {class_name: rrf}
  generation_pipeline:
    class_name: generation_pipeline
    reasoner:
      class_name: decomposition
      rerank_evidence: true      # CE re-orders the pooled passages against the original question
      evidence_top_k: 16         # then hands the reader only the best 16
```

(HyDE costs one LLM call per sub-question; the evidence rerank is the local cross-encoder — free
and offline. On single-hop/layout corpora prefer the quality profile above: HyDE measured null
there.)

## Modes

- **`MODE='embedded'`** (default) — runs the whole pipeline in-process over SQLite; each ingest call
  processes to completion. Zero infrastructure.
- **`MODE='distributed'`** — enqueues to pgQueuer over Postgres; run `python run_worker.py` as one or more
  separate consumer processes.

Configuration is environment-driven (pydantic-settings, `GROUP__FIELD` convention, e.g. `EMBEDDING__MODEL`,
`DATABASE__DOCUMENT_URL`); see `.env.example`.
