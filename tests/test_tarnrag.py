"""The TarnRag facade.

Two tiers. The **plumbing** tests — construction, ``open`` / ``close`` / ``retrieval_context``, the
index-identity stamp+validate, and the report paths — run everywhere: they never embed, so a dummy
tokenizer file (see ``_plumbing_settings``) is enough and no ONNX model is needed. The **end-to-end**
tests that actually embed text (ingest → retrieve → ask) are marked ``@requires_model`` and skip when the
model hasn't been fetched. The LLM is always injected, so no API key is needed.
